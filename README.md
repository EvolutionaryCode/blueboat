# blueboat

Blueboat is a simple game server backend for NodeJS focused on scalability. Blueboat's job is to focus on networking, timing, and state management so that you can focus on what makes your game special. 

Blueboat was created by and for [Gimkit](https://www.gimkit.com), and because of that, it has some opinionated decisions and requirements. Blueboat's main goal is to be scalable so that you don't have to change anything as your game grows.

**Blueboat takes care of**
* Real-time communication between server and clients
* State synchronization   
* Room joining/leaving
* Timing events
* Scaling

**Blueboat does not take care of**
* Matchmaking
* Game or Physics Engine
* External Database (for saving player stats)
